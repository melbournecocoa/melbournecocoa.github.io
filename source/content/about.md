Melbourne CocoaHeads has been running monthly since 2007 and is Melbourneâ€™s longest running independent Apple developer community event.

We're run by a small group of volunteers and supported by the wider Melbourne community. Each month members volunteer their time to present on iOS, macOS and software development topics. Events are also streamed to YouTube.

CocoaHeads is open to everyone. A diverse range of people come to the meetings including hobbyist developers, designers, freelance contractors, commercial and indie developers. Whatever your background, the CocoaHeads community is a fantastic, supportive group who are all ears when it comes to discussing development for iOS and macOS.

## Code of Conduct

All of Melbourne CocoaHeads' events and associated channels are covered by a Code of Conduct. All a members or attendees of CocoaHeads events are expected to be familiar with our code of conduct.
