After five years ordering the pizzas and findind different ways to hide misspelt words in slide decks, the time has come for me to move on and hand over the role and responsibility of "Organiser" of our community to somebody new. This post is to announce that I will be stepping down from my role of Melbourne CocoaHeads organiser effective July 11 after the [July presentation night](/events/meetup-2019-07-11).

Over the last 10 or so years, Melbourne CocoaHeads has been something I have truely enjoyed as both an attendee and organiser. Running the monthly meetups over the last five years has been a special privilege and I'd like to thank everyone who has presented, sponsored and attended - you've made the the whole experience an absolute blast.

I'd like to especially thank Rob Amos and Luke Tupper for picking up the slack on the presentation and hack nights over the entire period.

As the meetup scene has evolved, so has Melbourne CocoHeads and I am proud to have been involved with the implementation of a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct), and the creation of a partnership with our friends over at [GDG Melbourne](https://www.gdgmelbourne.com) via our collaborative monthly Hack Night events, and yearly Christmas parties.

In more minor achievements, the majority of our recent presentations are published over on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/MelbourneCocoaHeads), and nearly all assets are open source on [Github](http://github.com/melbournecocoa/).

Having said all of that, we are now on the look out for someone (or multiple people) from the community to put their hands up to take over Melbourne CocoaHeads going forward.

### Shaping CocoaHeads Next

To help facilitate the next steps, we will be running a "Melbourne CocoaHeads Planning meeting" on April 16 to discuss roles and responsibilities for CocoaHeads going forward. Itty Bitty Apps have offered up their office for an after work meeting one evening. You can find out more information and RSVP [here](/events/planning-meeting-2019-04-16).

Those interested in the ongoing management of the group are welcome to attend - please watch the **#melbournecocoa-next** slack channel and this website and the twitter account for updates.

Public discussions and questions on next steps will also take place in the **#melbournecocoa-next** slack channel.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me with any questions or enquiries. You can reach me at <jesse@melbournecocoaheads.com>.
