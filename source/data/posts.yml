      <p>After five years ordering the pizzas and findind different ways to hide misspelt words in slide decks, the time has come for me to move on and hand over the role and responsibility of "Organiser" of our community to
       somebody new. This post is to announce that I will be stepping down from my role of Melbourne CocoaHeads organiser effective July 11 after the
      <a href="/events/meetup-2019-07-11">July presentation night</a>.</p>

      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/oisin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@oisin</a> listen to <a href="https://twitter.com/sirjec?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@sirjec</a> :) <a href="http://t.co/OF2MmEOlzd">pic.twitter.com/OF2MmEOlzd</a></p>&mdash; Baz Scott (@bazscott) <a href="https://twitter.com/bazscott/status/611484756593655809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

      <p>Over the last 10 or so years, Melbourne CocoaHeads has been something I have truely enjoyed as both an attendee and organiser. Running the monthly meetups over the last
      five years has been a special privilege and I'd like to thank everyone who has presented, sponsored and attended - you've made the the whole experience
      an absolute blast.</p>

      <p>I'd like to especially thank Rob Amos and Luke Tupper for picking up the slack on the presentation and hack nights over the entire period.</p>

      <p>As the meetup scene has evolved, so has Melbourne CocoHeads and I am proud to have been involved with the implementation of
      a <a href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>, and the creation of a partnership with our friends over at <a href="https://www.gdgmelbourne.com">GDG Melbourne</a>
      via our collaborative monthly Hack Night events, and yearly Christmas parties.</p>
      <p>In more minor achievements, the majority of our recent presentations are published over on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MelbourneCocoaHeads">YouTube</a>, and nearly all assets
      are open source on <a href="http://github.com/melbournecocoa/">Github</a>.</p>

      <p>Having said all of that, we are now on the look out for someone (or multiple people) from the community to put their hands up to take over
      Melbourne CocoaHeads going forward.</p>

      <p>What happens when you combine abstract ideas with the power of technology? From building vehicles out of shopping carts to playing tetris on a building, hackers bring novelty in unexpected ways. Join us in this talk bringing together the history of hacker culture and the hacker ethic, and how they cross both economic and cultural barriers.</p>

      <p>Once again we will be doing awful startup pitches! “Uber for clowns”, “Cloud services for toddlers”, “Twitter for dogs” - We will be putting together elevator pitches for some truly terrible startup ideas. Teams will be formed on the night and you will get to pick a ‘terrible startup idea’ out of a hat. Each team will have 10 minutes to put together an elevator pitch for their startup. Prizes will be awarded for ‘worst startup idea’.<p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Prizes</h3>

      <p>2018 has been a great year to date for CocoaHeads, we've had excellent presentations volunteered each month. If you've missed any, all 22 have been published
      over on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRdg1MF7wOwySNZgwwKPS0vV6TxxbUbK-"> Melbourne CocoaHeads "2018 Presentations" playlist</a> over on YouTube.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">A callout for speakers</h3>

      <p>Having said that, I'm calling out for more speakers to fill out the rest of 2018. Right now we have presentation spots open for all three of our remaining
      events. <strong>October 11</strong>, <strong>November 8</strong> and <strong>December 13</strong>. We've got the sponsors and venue, now we just need <strong>you</strong>!</p>


      <h3 class="section-heading">What's in a presentation?</h3>

      <img src="/img/posts/2018-10/raun_dev_2018-Jul-12.jpg" alt="@argentumko presneting on macOS Marzipan" class="img-responsive">

      <p><i>@argentumko presneting on macOS Marzipan - image credit <a href="https://twitter.com/raun_dev/status/1017335286072684544">@raun_dev</a></i>.</p>

      <p>A presentation is either a "Lightning talk" of about 5 or 10 minutes or a longer full presentation of about 20 to 25 minutes. The topic can be anything of your choosing as long
      as it's loosely related to iOS or macOS development. "Loosely related" is a broad term, but if you work in the industry (or are trying too!) then anything about your experiences with code,
      tools, designs, or just something you've learnt lately that you've found interesting. Sometimes the <strong>simpler</strong> the topic the better!</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Support for speakers</h3>

      <p>Speaking at a meetup can be daunting. Involving first time speakers, new members to the group or the industry is something I'm passionate about. If you need convincing
      <a href="mailto:jesse@melbournecocoaheads.com">get in touch with me</a> and I'll give you my spiel!</p>

      <p>To support new or interested speakers we have a dedicated #speakers channel in the <a href="http://slack.melbournecocoaheads.com/">melbournecocoaheads slack organisation</a> especially
      for discussing ideas and helping with questions, and as I said I'm keen to help anyone with ideas or queries either over email or a coffee.</p>

      <p>Just quickly on YouTube - all of our presentations have been live streamed and published to YouTube so far this year for future reference but this is <strong>100% optional</strong>.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Get in touch</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>You can use the <a href="https://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/talks">"Submit A Talk" form</a> that gets directed to me.</li>
        <li>You can call out in the #speakers channel in the <a href="http://slack.melbournecocoaheads.com/">melbournecocoaheads slack organisation</a>.</li>
        <li>You can get in touch with me directly at jesse@melbournecocoaheads.com</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Cheers!</p>

      <p>
        After a longer than usual break, Melbourne CocoaHeads gets back underway <a href="/events/meetup-2018-02-08">later this week</a> for 2018. I thought I'd share some updates on some changes we're implementing
        as a result of our super successful planning meeting. For more on what was discussed at the meeting, checkout the detailed <a href="https://github.com/melbournecocoa/MelbourneCocoaHeadsHistory/blob/master/2018-planning-meeting-notes.mdown">meeting notes</a>.

      <h3 class="section-heading">The 2018 tldr;</h3>

      <ul>
      <li>We're tightening up the presentation night schedule. Pizza from 6:00pm; finish by 8:30pm at the latest.</li>
      <li>A revamped Hack Night. It's all about creating an encouraging night for new people, mentoring and learning.</li>
      <li>We're implementing a code of conduct.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Presentation Night Schedule</h3>

      <p>
        For 2018 we're tightening up the schedule, moving the pizza first and aiming to fill the first two hours with all the content
        so people don't feel they miss out when they have to head home after the old pizza break time.

      <h3 class="section-heading">A revamped Hack Night</h3>

      <p>
        Hack Night for 2018 takes on a whole new format. Look out for the events as they are annouced on Meetup. Here's the pitch...
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Bring your laptop and your iOS, macOS, tvOS or watchOS project to the ultimate hack night. An all-ages alcohol-free event welcoming everyone.
        It will be held in a professional environment to allow you to work on your project. Get help from industry experts who are on hand to help you out.</i>

        <dt>6:45 - 8:30</dt>
        <dd>Hacking!</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Code of Conduct</h3>

      <p>
        At the planning meeting we discussed formalising the kind of behaviour and leadership we expect from new and existing members of the group.
        Detailed notes of the discussion are highlighted in the <a href="https://github.com/melbournecocoa/MelbourneCocoaHeadsHistory/blob/master/2018-planning-meeting-notes.mdown#discussion---code-of-conduct--diversity">meeting notes</a>
        and the group came to the conclusion that we will put together a Code of Conduct / Rules of Engagement document. This document will be published in the coming weeks.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Annual Sponsorship</h3>

      <p>
        This year we're offering annual sponsorships at three different levels with one major sponsor. Please <a href="mailto:jesse@melbournecocoaheads.com">get in touch with me</a> with me if you or your company would like to sponsor us for the year.

      <h3 class="section-heading">2018 Planning Meeting</h3>

      <p>
        I have scheduled an <strong>open meeting</strong> for anyone interested volunteering their time to help organise and run Melbourne CocoaHeads
        throughout 2018 and beyond. It's a great opporunity to come up with new ideas and involve more of us in the month to month running of the event.
        For a bit more background on this meeting see the <a href="https://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/2018">Melbourne CocoaHeads 2018</a> blog post from earlier this year.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Where and When</h3>
        The meeting will take place at the Itty Bitty Apps offices in the CBD on <a href="/events/planning-meeting-2017-10-26">Thursday December 7th from 5:45pm</a>. <strong>If you would like to attend
        please get in touch with me directly and I will invite you to RSVP via the relevant channels</strong>. There will be a limit on the total number of people to keep things comfortable.
        If you can't physically make it into the CBD on the night, it's possible I could setup a Google Hang Out session.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">What and Why</h3>

      <p>
        I have a <a href="https://gist.github.com/jessedc/3ae72609e53c0dc627711494d72bbfc0">rough gist</a> document outlining some thoughts,
        roles and opportunities to expand and improve CocoaHeads in 2018. Key to my thoughts are sharing the responsibility of running
        CococaHeads every month, encouraging new members and bringing back the hacking at the Hack Nights. I hope to revise the gist a bit
        prior to Thursday but I'm happy to take feedback as comments or directly at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        A more structured agenda will be provided to everyone attending prior to the night and there should be plenty of time for unplanned agenda items on the night. Basic minutes from
        the meeting will be posted here and added to the the <a href="https://github.com/melbournecocoa/MelbourneCocoaHeadsHistory/">Melbourne CocoaHeads History</a> repository.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are interested in helping out please get in touch with me at <a href="mailto:jesse@melbournecocoaheads.com">jesse@melbournecocoaheads.com</a> and I will
        loop you in with an invitation to RSVP. You can also reach out to myself, Rob Amos, Ben Deckys or Gavan Chan on <a href="https://slack.melbournecocoaheads.com">Slack</a>
        for more info or with any queries.

        Historically, Melbourne CocoaHeads takes a summer break in January and we start the year off in February.
      </p>

      <p>This year we will be taking an <strong>extended break</strong>. Our <a href="/events/meetup-2017-10-12">October Meetup No. #110</a>
      will be the last official meetup for 2017. Hack nights and NSBreakfast events will still be scheduled for November and December as usual.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">2018 Organisational Meeting</h3>

      <p>
      Taking a break enables us to look ahead to 2018. It's a chance to get out in front and organise venues, sponsors, volunteers
      and topics. It's a chance to take stock of the successes and challenges of 2017.
      </p>

      <p>
      In place of our November meetup, I'll be scheduling an <strong>open meeting</strong> for anyone interested in
      contributing feedback or their time to help organise Melbourne CocoaHeads in 2018.

      <strong>Update:</strong> The planning meeting was postponed and will be held at the Itty Bitty Apps offices in December. <a href="/events/planning-meeting-2017-10-26">See here</a> for more details.
      </p>

      <p>
      Minutes of the meeting will be posted here and added to the the
      <a href="https://github.com/melbournecocoa/MelbourneCocoaHeadsHistory/">Melbourne CocoaHeads History</a> github repo.
      </p>

      <p>A brief, incomplete outline of some of the topics to cover are below:</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Volunteering in 2018</h3>

      <p>
        CocoaHeads has always relied on the community members to keep it running. Sharing this responsibility is going to
        be key in 2018. Too much consolidation of responsibility is a risk. I'm looking for volunteers/co-organisers to
        help out in the following areas:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Community Coordination</strong> - Meetup dates, website blog updates, Meetup.com admin, slack admin, responding to emails, invoicing and following up payments.</li>
        <li><strong>Speakers Coordination</strong> - Following up interested speakers, reaching out to people ahead of time.
        Encouraging new speakers.</li>
        <li><strong>Sponsorship Coordination</strong> - Reaching out to potential sponsors.</li>
        <li><strong>Logistics Coordination</strong> - Food and drinks ordering, delivery, setup on the night.</li>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Hack Nights in 2018</h3>

      <p>
      If I could find a volunteer to help, I'd like to make an effort to formalise the Hack Nights with a venue and a sponsor.
      This could open up the hack night to be an avenue providing support for new members of the community and a space for
      hacking on that side project in a comfortable co-working like environment.
      </p>
      <p>
      I envision the current Hack Night becoming something like a <i>drinks night</i>, maintaining it's relaxed atmosphere and location.
      </p>

      <p>I would <strong>love</strong> feedback and input on this idea.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Sponsors and Venues</h3>

      <p>
        Our current model is one company sponsors the drinks and food each month and we have an ongoing sponsor who provides
        their venue. It was a bit different in <a href="https://github.com/melbournecocoa/MelbourneCocoaHeadsHistory/blob/master/2011.mdown">2011</a> with different venues each month as well.
      </p>

      <p>There's a lot of overhead in finding sponsors each month, invoicing and following up payment - in 2018 I'd like to
      explore the possibility of a more efficient sponsorship model with longer term (year long) sponsorships.</p>

      <p>Venue wise, we've been very lucky over the years with some great venues. I'd like to see what options we could
      come up with for 2018.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Future CocoaHeads</h3>

      <p>
        This year Melbourne CocoaHeads eclipsed <a href="https://github.com/melbournecocoa/MelbourneCocoaHeadsHistory/blob/master/2007.mdown">10 years of meetups</a>.
        An independent community meeting over decade is something I don't think get's highlighted enough. Over this whole time Melbourne CocoaHeads has been run <strong>by the community</strong>
        for the sole benefit <strong>of the community</strong>. I'm really excited about where the Apple/Mobile/Melbourne tech community is headed and can't wait for 2018.
      </p>
      <p>If any of the above inspires you to get involved please get in touch with me directly at <a href="mailto:jesse@melbournecocoaheads.com">jesse@melbournecocoaheads.com</a>.</p>

      <p>It's been a lot of fun running themed meetups over the past few months. We've had great talks on UIKit, WWDC 2017,
      Architecture and Swift 4. For September and October our topics are <strong>Automation and tooling</strong> and <strong>AR Kit</strong> respectively.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Automation and Tooling</h3>

      <p>Automation and tooling can cover anything from ways you and your team use Xcode to automation and testing practices you use (or would like to use!) in your projects.
      It's broad topic and we've had a lot of good presentations over the years. With Apple's tools improving significantly over the years and awesome third party
      tools becoming widely adopted like <a href="https://fastlane.tools">Fastlane</a> and <a href="https://www.buddybuild.com">Buddy Build</a>, there's lots to learn and share.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">AR Kit</h3>

      <p>Probably <a href="http://www.madewitharkit.com">the hottest topic right now</a> in iOS so I'm posting the topic nice and early! Bring your demos, trials, errors and anything else you've been tinkering with
      within ARKit. The more lightning talks we have on the night the better - but if anyone has enough time to put together a 20 minute presentation on "getting started with ARKit"
      please put your hand up - it will be well received.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">#speakers and /talks </h3>

      <p>As usual, head over to the #speakers channel on slack, or submit your ideas to me via the <a href="/talks">/talks</a> form. You can invite yourself to our slack channel
      at <a href="https://slack.melbournecocoaheads.com">here</a></p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Thanks to our September and October sponsors</h3>

      <p>I posted a poll in slack last week with some ideas for upcoming meetup topics. Here's the outcome of the votes:</p>

      <img src="/img/posts/june2017-poll.jpg" class="img-responsive" />

      <p>Therefore, the upcoming months' themes will be Architecture, Swift 4, Automation and tooling. We will vote on
      October through to December at some point after the July meetup but <strong>ideas are always welcome</strong>.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">July 2017 - Architecture</h3>

      <p>Architecture was the highest voted topic. It's broad and sometimes controversial. The discussions on who and what
      will be presented are ongoing in the public #speakers slack channel. If you have a take on a common (or not common)
      iOS/mobile/macOS architecture pattern you'd like to share, feel free to join #speakers and add your idea.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">August 2017 - Swift 4</h3>

      <p>By August we'll be reasonably close the the Swift 4 / Xcode 9 release - it could be a good idea to dedicate a
      month to talking about new swift language features, and even some of the advancements in programming with swift in general.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">September 2017 - Automation and Tooling</h3>

      <p>If Xcode 9 isn't out by the September meetup it won't be far away. We already know we have a new build system with Xcode 9,
      this includes advancements in tooling and automation (multi simulators!) - I know automation is a passion of a lot of people
      so let's talk about all that.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">October - December 2017 - TBC</h3>

      <p>There are still a lot of ideas we could cover for the last three months. We could dedicate particular months to large frameworks
      like Foundation or CoreAnimation or focus on smaller/newer frameworks like ARKit. I liked the idea of a beginners month that could
      appeal to a different audience to usual and might appeal to first time speakers.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Lightning Talks</h3>

      <p>Lightning talks are still lightning talks. If you've got an app to demo, a new feature or trick you've learnt and you want to
      show it off, if we've got time they're more than welcome any month. Just let me/us know either in #speakers, via <a href="/talks">/talks</a> or
      just directly via email.</p>

      It would be great to get some presentations on new things in Swift/Xcode, iOS/tvOS/watchOS, <small>macOS</small>. There's less than a week

      <p>At last week's meetup I was excited to announce some changes in the way we will run our monthly meetups. These
      changes will take effect from May on a trial basis, and if things go well we can continue to iterate. Any feedback
      on these changed are more than welcome.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">CocoaHeads Crew</h3>

      <p>Melbourne CocoaHeads over the years has often been a one person operation, throughout 2017 we've semi-formalised
      a working group who will help share the load of planning our monthly meetups.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Jesse Collis <a href="https://www.twitter.com/sirjec">@sirjec</a></strong> - Jesse's been organising
        Melbourne CococaHeads since August 2014 and is known for mispelling things.</li>
        <li><strong>Andyy Hope <a href="https://www.twitter.com/andyyhope">@andyyhope</a></strong> - Organiser of the
        excellent <a href="http://www.playgroundscon.com">Playgrounds Conference</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Rob Amos</strong> - <a href="https://www.twitter.com/bok_">@bok_</a> - Organiser of the
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/AWS-AUS/">Amazon WebServices User Group</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Ben Deckys</strong> - <a href="https://www.twitter.com/cocotutch">@cocotutch</a> - Regular presenter
        of the monthly <i>The Month That Was</i>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Themed Meetups</h3>

      <p>As a way to shake things up a bit we thought it might be an interesting idea to theme our meetups for the
      remainder of 2017. Having a set theme up front gives everyone time to come up with presentation ideas and possibly
      even learn something new to present. It gives us something to promote to the wider Melbourne community as a reason
      to attend a particular CocoaHeads event and it may provide opportunities for us to reach out to particular people
      to come and present where they otherwise wouldn't.</p>

      <p>In the coming days we'll ask for wider feedback on topics and based on that we'll set a few themes upfront. For our
      <strong><a href="/events/meetup-2017-05-11">May meetup</a></strong>, the topic will be <strong>UIKit</strong>. This
      is a broad topic, but something most of us work with regularly.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Lightning Talks</h3>
      <p>We're going to keep lightning talks unchanged. They will remain short, sharp and spontaneous. They don't have
      to be on topic. Having said that, <i>Lightning Talk Month</i> which is usually scheduled for July will be replaced
      with a set theme.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Speaker Mentoring</h3>

      <p>Speaking at any meetup for the first time is daunting, but it's one of the best things you can to do practice
      your presentation skills. We've setup a #speakers channel in slack where we hope we can provide a relaxed environment
       to answer any questions people may have about speaking or about their ideas.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">June Meetup</h3>

      <p>WWDC clashes with our dates again this year, we will push the date back to <i>after</i> the event, and the theme
      in June will be <strong>What's new in iOS/watchOS/tvOS/macOS</strong>. It should be great fun, if you're keen to
      present (even without knowing what's coming), put your name down now and we can work it out as we go along.</p>

      <p>After a huge week last week with the inaugural playgrounds conference, we're back for March next week!</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Presentations for March</h3>

      <p><strong>Jesse Collis <a href="https://www.twitter.com/sirjec">@sirjec</a> - The Month That Was</strong></p>

      <p>A light hearted look back at the industry happenings since our last meetup.</p>

      <p><strong>Tristan Ludowyk <a href="https://www.twitter.com/tristandl">@tristandl</a> - Side effects with ReSwift and Rx: Introducing redux-observable</strong></p>

      <p>Redux is a great way to avoid problems that arise from state mutation spread throughout your code. It makes changes to state declarative using one-way data
      flow. Rx is a multi-platform library that provides functional and reactive (although strictly not functional reactive) programming techniques.</p>

      <p>In this talk
      we will show how we have leveraged both these libraries to create an Rx Observable of both the whole Redux app state as well as individual components of
      the state, meaning you can do things like reactive bindings in the UI. Furthermore, we will see how redux-observable allows us to use reactive programming
      and composition to create async effects that dispatch actions to the redux reducer(s).</p>

      <p><strong>Erica Chan - What the hell is Technology Law?</strong></p>

      <p>A quick introduction to Technology Law and key issues for developers to think about.</p>

      <p><strong>Jinju Jang <a href="https://www.twitter.com/arle13">@arle13</a> - Using Lottie</strong></p>

      <p>The Airbnb engineering team have released a library for converting After Effect animation to JSON file, that you can use for native apps.
      I'm going to share my short experience of using Lottie for an iOS project.</p>

      <p><strong>Dr. Soumitri Varadarajan - Why not practice Codesign?</strong></p>

      <p>A team of designers and researchers from RMIT University work with hospital patients and staff to collaboratively design patient experiences and services.
      Often the these services aere accessed through an iOS app.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">New Venue!</h3>

      <p>I'm excited to announce that starting from the <a href="/events/14">August meetup #97</a> we will be moving homes from Teamsquare
       to <a href="http://www.outware.com.au">Outware</a> on La Trobe Street!</p>

      <p>Outware have an excellent central space at <strong>Level 3 469 La Trobe Street</strong> overlooking the Flagstaff gardens and are right
       next to Flagstaff station. Make sure you take note of the new address, I have updated everything relevant to reflect the new venue
       and I'll reach out more directly closer to the date.</p>

      <p>I'd like to take this chance to say thanks to the Michael and the team at Teamsquare for hosting us since August 2015,
      they have been excellent hosts for a lot of Melbourne meetups over the last year and I know everyone's enjoyed using the space a lot. </p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">NS Breakfast</h3>

      <p>NSBreakfast is now a recurring event, on the first Friday of the month from 7:30am. Checkout the <a href="/events">events</a> page for
       more information on the next NSBreakfast.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Submit your talks for August</h3>

      <p> So far I don't have many presentations lined up for August, head over to <a href="/talks">/talks</a> to submit your
      talk!</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Live Streaming</h3>

      <p>I've noticed a few issues with the live stream over the last few months. I'm hoping to get these issues ironed out once I sort out the
      setup at Outware.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">July is Lightning Talk Month</h3>

      <p>Over the last couple of years, we pick one month and dedicate it purely to lightning talks. This year should be excellent
      since we're in Xcode 8, iOS 10, Swift 3 beta land and everything is new and shiny.</p>

      <p>The plan for July is to have as many lightning talks as we can, one after another from about 6:45pm through to 9:30/10.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Definition of a "Lightning Talk"</h3>

      <p>Lightning talks are quick (0 - 5 minutes) presentations on short, sharp topics that will keep the audience engaged. If you
      think of it in slides, it's probably a five slide presentation, although slides are optional.</p>

      <p>Topics/ideas could include: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A demo of some code you've just got working in the latest beta (perfect for Xcode slaygrounds)</li>
        <li>Demo of your latest iOS app update, or a preview of an upcoming one</li>
        <li>Demo of an open source project you like, have forked, fixed or written yourself</li>
        <li>Dramatic reading of some Apple documentation</li>
        <li>Something you learnt/didn't learn from WWDC</li>
        <li>An appropriate rant on something you like/dislike about something or other in the Cocoa/iOS/macOS land</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you've never thought of doing a presentation at CocoaHeads before, a lightning talk is a great place to start.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">I'm in. How do I submit a talk?</h3>

      <p>Excellent! Head over to <a href="/talks">/talks</a>, submit your idea and I'll get back to you if I need to clarify anything.</p>

      <h3>tldr;</h3>

      <p>I've made an online form for everyone to submit talk proposals so I don't forget anyone who is scheduled to present each month.</p>

      <p>That form is <a href="http://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/talks">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>"You had one job..."</h3>

      <p>Throughout each month it's one of my main tasks (along with working out what to mispell in my introduction slides)
      to organise the presenters list for the next meetup and the meetup after that. Earlier this month I knew I'd forgotten
      one speaker and in fact after publishing the list for April, I'd actually forgotten two.</p>

      <img src="/img/posts/jc-forgets.jpg" class="img-responsive">

      <p>Presentation submissions come to me via Slack, Email, Twitter (publicly and privately), iMessage and in person. The
      critical flaw with my single-text-file-on-a-macbook system is it relies on me <strong>remembering</strong> to update it
      and remembering where to find everyone's details.</p>

      <p>As it turns out I'm slightly better at programming than event management so I've gone and PHP'd a form over
      at <a href="http://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/talks">melbournecocoaheads.com/talks</a> that everyone can fill out
      to give me their plan for a talk. It's in one place, I can't forget it. Submitting this form saves a row in the
      database and forwards me an email with all the details.</p>

      <p>Following up prior to each month and getting everyone's details right will now be much more straight forward.</p>

      <p>At this stage we're looking for a couple of additional presentations and lightening talks. <strong>If you've got an idea for a talk or have done something cool over the break
      you want to share with everyone please get in touch!</strong></p>

      <h3>Remembering Tom Parry</h3>

      <p>Over the break we were informed of some very sad news. A long time Melbourne CocoaHeads member, Tom Parry passed away.</p>

      <p>Tom was a great contributor to Melbourne CocoaHeads over the years. He was a regular atendee, alway asking good questions
      during presentations and he himself presented his <a href="https://github.com/tparry/PDFImage.framework">PDFImage.framework</a> project in October 2014.
      Tom also gave us a lightning talk in December 2015 on a new app he had worked on named <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/rise-recharge/id962974154?mt=8"> Rise and Recharge</a> for Baker IDI.</p>

      <h3>New Website</h3>

      <p>I've put together this new website with a new calendar, a RSS feed and an API to help keep things organised in 2016.
      The new setup moves us away from the padded world of WYSIWYG editors and theme pickers at Squarespace and into the amazing world of hand crafted CSS and #Javascipt.</p>

      <p>The new site is <a href="https://github.com/melbournecocoa/website">open source</a>, written in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RdaFJ.gif">PHP</a> and using the
      <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a> framework. It is hosted on Heroku. Contributions are welcome.</p>

      <h3>Venue</h3>

      <p>Teamsquare have been confirmed as hosts for the whole year.<p>

      <h3>Sponsors</h3>

      <p>Sponsors are being sought for Feb - December.</p>

      <h3>Event Calendar</h3>

      <p>The old Google calendar was just another thing I would forget to update so I've integrated a calendar feed here that I don't have to manage separately.</p>

      <p>Subscribe to the new calendar feed <a href="/calendar">here</a>.</p>

      <p>All events for 2016 are scheduled (even the tentative ones) over on the <a href="/events" title="Events Page">events page</a>.</p>

      <p>Each event links through to relevant updates on the event, ticketing and location and sponsor information.</p>

      <h3>RSS Feed</h3>

      <p>The new RSS feed represents the updates that appear over at the <a href="/updates">updates</a> page. This feed is also syndicated in the #general cocoaheads slack channel.

      <p>Subscribe RSS feed <a href="/rss">here</a>.</p>

      <H3>Events API</h3>

      <p>The events API is a JSON representation of the events. There are three simple endpoints.</p>

      <ul>
          <li><code>/api/events</code> - All upcoming scheduled events</li>
          <li><code>/api/events/past</code> - All past events</li>
          <li><code>/api/events/next</code> - Just the next hack night and meetup</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Just throw a GET request at these endpoints and you'll get a JSON response.</p>

      <h3>Slack</h3>

      <p>Just a shout out for our slack channel. We are over 130 people strong at the moment and has more or less consumed all the traffic from the mailing list.
      If you'd like an invite get in touch with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/sirjec">twitter</a> or via <a href="mailto:jesse@jcmultimedia.com.au">email</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Yeah okay, but who's speaking this month?</h2>

      <p>This month we're going to skip the formalities and presentations - we'd like you to get up and say hi.</p>

      <p>Every month there are are more and more new faces coming to cocoaheads, new companies in Melbourne
          and surrounds doing amazing stuff and we'd like as many people as possible to stand up, say hi,
          say who you are, (maybe who you work for) and what you're working on.</p>

      <p>In my mind we'll spend some time before pizzas handing around the microphone and everyone can take
          it in turns hopping up and giving a 30 second spiel on themselves or give a quick app demo if
          it's relevant. It would be cool if you let us know who you are, what you're working on, what you're
          interested in or just why you come to cocoaheads. (If you're worried about this impending public
          speaking situation or need some ideas or encouragement, let Pete and/or I know and we can give
          you ideas ahead of time.)</p>

      <p>Melbourne CocoaHeads is the <strong>top</strong> Cocoa based community across the globe, and is
          known for being the <strong>friendliest</strong>, fastest growing, <strong>highest quality</strong>
          presentation holding, best beverage providing meetup ever. <strong>Awesome people like you</strong>
          make this fact, so please come this month and share a little about yourself.</p>

      <p>We (Pete and Jesse) will put together a slide for each person, so just shoot through your details to Jesse and/or Pete:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Your name</li>
          <li>Who you work for / What you work on / What you study</li>
          <li>Twitter / github handle</li>
      </ul>
